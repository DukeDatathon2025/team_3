This is the main hub for repositories that host various datathon projects, resources, and tools.\n","\n","## The Challenge 🏆\n","\n"," The main challenge of this Datathon is to answer questions in medicine using electronic health record (EHR) data. This datathon, sponsored by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, specifically focuses on critical care data - data from the intensive care unit (ICU). Our three sub-foci for the 2023 Datathon are **COVID-19**, **health equity**, and **patient safety**.\n","\n"," Participating teams will be composed of clinical and data science participants. Mentors with expertise in datasets and analytic techniques will bring their unique perspectives, experience, and critical thinking to the table!\n","\n","We believe that reproducible, transparent research can help advance the field, so all our code is open-source. All data preparation and team's code will be made available on GitHub.\n","\n","We ask that you share your code back in your team. All teams who win must have documented code shared back to the GitHub to qualify for any prizes.\n","\n","## Overview of Repositories 📁\n","\n","Our repositories consist of projects, resources, and tools used during the datathon. Here's a brief overview of what you can find:\n","\n","- **Team Repositories (team_01 to team_10)**: 📈 These repositories contain notebooks assigned to each participating team.\n","- **Workshops**: 📚 This repository contains materials for the workshops held during the datathon.\n","- **Welcome Packages**: 🎁 Welcome packages and orientation for [mentors](https://github.com/SCCMdatathon/welcome-mentors) and [participants](https://github.com/SCCMdatathon/welcome-students) participating in the datathon.\n","- **FAQ**: [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LqgVQERRydE90hk12VSzo57o0isaNDRbYukNbtr2310/edit)\n","- **Data Preparation**: 🔧 [Data-prep](https://github.com/SCCMdatathon/data-prep) repository contains code to curate ICU Pulse Oximetry data.\n","\n","Much thanks to the MIT Critical Datathon as an example (https://github.com/orgs/CriticalDatathon/, hosted at MIT on 18-19 May 2023)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"1Oo2iFzTHMNF"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7pizABRCI3Cq"},"source":["## Links to
