Considerable advances have since been made into the pathobiology (changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation), management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination.To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock.A task force (n = 19) with expertise in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement (by 31 societies listed in the Acknowledgment).Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term severe sepsis was redundant.Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction can be represented by an increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more, which is associated with an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%. Septic shock should be defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (&gt;18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%. In out-of-hospital, emergency department, or general hospital ward settings, adult patients with suspected infection can be rapidly identified as being more likely to have poor outcomes typical of sepsis if they have at least 2 of the following clinical criteria that together constitute a new bedside clinical score termed quickSOFA (qSOFA): respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less.These updated definitions and clinical criteria should replace previous definitions, offer greater consistency for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials, and facilitate earlier recognition and more timely management of patients with sepsis or at risk of developing sepsis.","2016-02-23","2025-04-25 16:43:07","2025-04-25 16:43:07","2025-04-25 16:43:07","801-810","","8","315","","JAMA","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>Guidelines for defining sepsis</p> </div>","/Users/brycehendren/Zotero/storage/SJIS4VDH/Singer et al. - 2016 - The Third International Consensus Definitions for .pdf; /Users/brycehendren/Zotero/storage/PF3SMHLP/2492881.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The progression of electronic medical records (EMR) offers the possibility of storing a large quantity of clinical data that can facilitate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine. However, several difficulties, such as poor structure and heterogenicity of the raw EMR data, are encountered when introducing AI with ICU data. Labor-intensive work, including manual data entry, personal medical records sorting, and laboratory results interpretation may hinder the progress of AI. In this article, we introduce the developing of an AI algorithm designed for sepsis diagnosis using pre-selected features; and compare the performance of the AI algorithm with SOFA score based diagnostic method. Materials and methods This is a prospective open-label cohort study. A specialized EMR, named TED_ICU, was implemented for continuous data recording. One hundred six clinical features relevant to sepsis diagnosis were selected prospectively. A labeling work to allocate SEPSIS or NON_SEPSIS status for each ICU patient was performed by the in-charge intensivist according to SEPSIS-3 criteria, along with the automatic recording of selected features every day by TED_ICU. Afterward, we use de-identified data to develop the AI algorithm. Several machine learning methods were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, and XGBoost, a decision-tree based algorithm was adopted for our AI algorithm development due to best performance. Results The study was conducted between August 2018 and December 2018 for the first stage of analysis. We collected 1588 instances, including 444 SEPSIS and 1144 NON-SEPSIS, from 434 patients. The 434 patients included 259 (59.6%) male patients and 175 female patients. The mean age was 67.6-year-old, and the mean APACHE II score was 13.8. The SEPSIS cohort had a higher SOFA score and increased use of organ support treatment. The AI algorithm was developed with a shuffle method using 80% of the instances for training and 20% for testing. The established AI algorithm achieved the following: accuracy = 82% ± 1%; sensitivity = 65% ± 5%; specificity = 88% ± 2%; precision = 67% ± 3%; and F1 = 0.66 ± 0.02. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was approximately 0.89. The SOFA score was used on the same 1588 instances for sepsis diagnosis, and the result was inferior to our AI algorithm (AUROC = 0.596). Conclusion Using real-time data, collected by EMR, from the ICU daily practice, our AI algorithm established with pre-selected features and XGBoost can provide a timely diagnosis of sepsis with an accuracy greater than 80%. AI algorithm also outperforms the SOFA score in sepsis diagnosis and exhibits practicality as clinicians can deploy appropriate treatment earlier. The early and precise response of this AI algorithm will result in cost reduction, outcome improvement, and benefit for healthcare systems, medical staff, and patients as well.","2020-09-01","2025-04-25 17:02:35","2025-04-25 17:02:35","2025-04-25 17:02:35","104176","","","141","","International Journal of Medical Informatics","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>Using AI EMR model vs SOFA to predict sepsis</p> </div>","/Users/brycehendren/Zotero/storage/2SS522IB/S1386505620301192.html","","","AI; Artificial intelligence; Critical care; Diagnostic algorithm; ICU; Sepsis; XGBoost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Retrospective analysis of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (from the MIMIC II dataset) who were not septic at the time of admission. Results A sepsis early warning algorithm, InSight, was developed and applied to the prediction of sepsis up to three hours prior to a patient's first five hour Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) episode. When applied to a never-before-seen set of test patients, InSight predictions demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.89–0.91) and a specificity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80–0.82), exceeding or rivaling that of existing biomarker detection methods. Across predictive times up to three hours before a sustained SIRS event, InSight maintained an average area under the ROC curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.80–0.86). Analysis of patient sepsis risk showed that contributions from the coevolution of multiple risk factors were more important than the contributions from isolated individual risk factors when making predictions further in advance. Conclusions Sepsis can be predicted at least three hours in advance of onset of the first five hour SIRS episode, using only nine commonly available vital signs, with better performance than methods in standard practice today. High-order correlations of vital sign measurements are key to this prediction, which improves the likelihood of early identification of at-risk patients.","2016-07-01","2025-04-25 17:08:25","2025-04-25 17:08:25","2025-04-25 17:08:24","69-73","","","74","","Computers in Biology and Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>Insight model using MIMIC II dataset</p> </div>","/Users/brycehendren/Zotero/storage/CLUEBTAE/S0010482516301123.html","","","Clinical decision support systems; Computer-assisted diagnosis; Early diagnosis; Medical informatics; Sepsis; Severe sepsis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study assesses the factors influencing the efficacy of ML models in sepsis prediction, aiming to optimize their use in clinical practice. Methods We searched Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, and CENTRAL for studies published from inception to October 2023. We focused on studies predicting sepsis in real-time settings in adult patients in any hospital settings without language limits. The primary outcome was area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. This meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA-NMA guidelines and Cochrane Handbook recommendations. A Network Meta-Analysis using the CINeMA approach compared ML models against traditional scoring systems, with meta-regression identifying factors affecting model quality. Results From 3,953 studies, 73 articles encompassing 457,932 septic patients and 256 models were analyzed. The pooled AUC for ML models was 0.825 and it significantly outperformed traditional scoring systems. Neural Network and Decision Tree models demonstrated the highest AUC metrics. Significant factors influencing AUC included ML model type, dataset type, and prediction window. Conclusion This study establishes the superiority of ML models, especially Neural Network and Decision Tree types, in sepsis prediction. It highlights the importance of model type and dataset characteristics for prediction accuracy, emphasizing the necessity for standardized reporting and validation in ML healthcare applications. These findings call for broader clinical implementation to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in diverse patient groups.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort for algorithm derivation and validation, pre-post impact evaluation. SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital system in Philadelphia, PA. PATIENTS: All non-ICU admissions; algorithm derivation July 2011 to June 2014 (n = 162,212); algorithm validation October to December 2015 (n = 10,448); silent versus alert comparison January 2016 to February 2017 (silent n = 22,280; alert n = 32,184). INTERVENTIONS: A random-forest classifier, derived and validated using electronic health record data, was deployed both silently and later with an alert to notify clinical teams of sepsis prediction. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULT: Patients identified for training the algorithm were required to have International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition codes for severe sepsis or septic shock and a positive blood culture during their hospital encounter with either a lactate greater than 2.2 mmol/L or a systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. The algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 98%, with a positive predictive value of 29% and positive likelihood ratio of 13. The alert resulted in a small statistically significant increase in lactate testing and IV fluid administration. There was no significant difference in mortality, discharge disposition, or transfer to ICU, although there was a reduction in time-to-ICU transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning algorithm can predict, with low sensitivity but high specificity, the impending occurrence of severe sepsis and septic shock. Algorithm-generated predictive alerts modestly impacted clinical measures. Next steps include describing clinical perception of this tool and optimizing algorithm design and delivery.","2019-11","2025-04-25 17:22:34","2025-04-25 17:22:34","","1485-1492","","11","47","","Crit Care Med","A Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31389839 PMCID: PMC8635476","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p>ML model that did not show any mortality benefit in using model</p> </div>","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31389839","","Algorithms; Cohort Studies; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electronic Health Records; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Machine Learning; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sepsis; Shock, Septic; Text Messaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Socioeconomic and demographic impacts on sepsis outcomes have been highlighted recently. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of SOFA scores against demographic and social health determinants for predicting sepsis mortality in critically ill patients, and to assess if a combined model increases predictive accuracy. METHODS: The study utilized retrospective data from the MIMIC-IV database and prospective external validation from the Penn State Health cohort. A Random Forest model incorporating SOFA scores, demographic/social data, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index was trained and validated. FINDINGS: In the MIMIC-IV dataset of 32,970 sepsis patients, 6,824 (20.7%) died within 30 days. A model including demographic, socioeconomic, and comorbidity data with SOFA scores improved predictive accuracy beyond SOFA scores alone. Day 2 SOFA, age, weight, and comorbidities were significant predictors. External validation showed consistent performance, highlighting the importance of delta SOFA between days 1 and 3. CONCLUSION: Adding patient-specific demographic and socioeconomic information to clinical metrics significantly improves sepsis mortality prediction. This suggests a more comprehensive, multidimensional prognostic approach is needed for accurate sepsis outcome predictions.","2024-10","2025-04-26 13:40:14","2025-04-26 13:40:14","","154857","","","83","","J Crit Care","Enhancing Sepsis prognosis","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38996498 PMCID: PMC11297654","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38996498","","Adult; Aged; Comorbidity; Critical Illness; Female; Humans; Machine learning; Male; Middle Aged; MIMIC database; Mortality; Organ Dysfunction Scores; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Sepsis; Sequential organ failure assessment score; Social Determinants of Health; Sociodemographic Factors; Socioeconomic Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predictive modeling has been suggested as a tool to identify high-risk patients. However, existing sepsis readmission models have low predictive value and most predictive factors in such models are not actionable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from patients enrolled in the AllofUs Research Program cohort from 35 hospitals were used to develop a multicenter validated sepsis-related unplanned readmission model that incorporates clinical and social determinants of health (SDH) to predict 30-day unplanned readmissions. Sepsis cases were identified using concepts represented in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership. The dataset included over 60 clinical/laboratory features and over 100 SDH features. RESULTS: Incorporation of SDH factors into our model of clinical and demographic features improves model area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) significantly (from 0.75 to 0.80; P < .001). Model-agnostic interpretability techniques revealed demographics, economic stability, and delay in getting medical care as important SDH predictive features of unplanned hospital readmissions. DISCUSSION: This work represents one of the largest studies of sepsis readmissions using objective clinical data to date (8935 septic index encounters). SDH are important to determine which sepsis patients are more likely to have an unplanned 30-day readmission. The AllofUS dataset provides granular data from a diverse set of individuals, making this model potentially more generalizable than prior models. CONCLUSION: Use of SDH improves predictive performance of a model to identify which sepsis patients are at high risk of an unplanned 30-day readmission.","2022-06-14","2025-04-26 13:43:04","2025-04-26 13:43:04","","1263-1270","","7","29","","J Am Med Inform Assoc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35511233 PMCID: PMC9196687","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35511233","","Humans; interpretable; Logistic Models; machine learning; OMOP; Patient Readmission; readmission; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; sepsis; Sepsis; Social Determinants of Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of SDOH and health scales in sepsis mortality risk prediction and hospital performance assessment. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: One hundred twenty-nine hospitals in the nationwide Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System between 2017 and 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Veterans admitted through emergency departments with community-acquired sepsis. EXPOSURES: Individual- and community-level SDOH (race, housing instability, marital status, Area Deprivation Index [ADI], and rural residence) and two health scales (the Care Assessment Need [CAN] score and Claims-Based Frailty Index [CFI]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was 90-day mortality from emergency department arrival; secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 144,889 patients admitted to the hospital with community-acquired sepsis, 139,080 were men (96.0%), median (IQR) age was 71 (64-77) years, and median (IQR) ADI was 60 (38-81). Multivariable regression models had good calibration and discrimination across models that adjusted for different sets of variables (e.g., AUROC, 0.782; Brier score, 1.33; and standardized mortality rate, 1.00). Risk-adjusted hospital performance was similar across all models. Among 129 VA hospitals, three hospitals shifted from the lowest or highest quintile of performance when comparing models that excluded SDOH to models that adjusted for all variables. Models that adjusted for ADI reported odds ratios (CI) of 1.00 (1.00-1.00), indicating that ADI does not significantly predict sepsis mortality in this cohort of patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In patients with community-acquired sepsis, adjusting for community SDOH variables such as ADI did not improve 90-day sepsis mortality predictions in mortality models and did not substantively alter hospital performance within the VA Healthcare System. Understanding the role of SDOH in risk prediction and risk adjustment models is vital because it could prevent hospitals from being negatively evaluated for treating less advantaged patients. However, we found that in VA hospitals, the potential impact of SDOH on 90-day sepsis mortality was minimal.","2024-12","2025-04-26 13:44:34","2025-04-26 13:44:34","","3129-3137","","16","39","","J Gen Intern Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 39375318 PMCID: PMC11618254","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39375318","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hospital Mortality; Hospitals, Veterans; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Sepsis; Social Determinants of Health; United States; United States Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
